# TODO pose estimation module
# TODO TTS module
# TODO pose classification module
# TODO excertion calculator module
# TODO main file - video capture and processing

# NOTE order of business - pose estimation first, 
# make a simple test file using downloaded videos
# while ai pose classification is being developed use switched functions

# NOTE I guess I can unify the excercises somewhat
# by counting the distance between
# key points, like wrist to sholder for curls, chest to wrist for pushups etc
